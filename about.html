      <p style="width: 50vh;">
        Am a first year computer science student.<br><br>
        Currently I enjoy watching anime and reading manga, and playing osu! and Genshin Impact.<br><br>
        I like a lot of outdoors stuff. I've been skiing all my life, but also enjoy mountain biking, rock climbing,
        hiking, backpacking, camping, and most other outdoors stuff.
